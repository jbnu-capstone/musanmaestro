# MUSAN-MAESTRO noise mixed piano performance data

- [MUSAN](https://www.openslr.org/17/): Noise data
- [MAESTRO](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/datasets/maestro): MIDI Aligned real piano performance data

This dataset was made in purpose of separating noise-mixed piano sound using [Conv-Tasnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.07454)

Being used in [jbnu-capstone/conv-tasnet-pytorch](https://github.com/jbnu-capstone/conv-tasnet-pytorch) which is based on [JusperLee/Conv-TasNet](https://github.com/JusperLee/Conv-TasNet)
